1/ **Clinton signed a more limited executive order on immigration**. The revised travel ban blocks entry to the US for citizens from six of the seven countries named in Clinton’s original order. People from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya will face a 90-day suspension of visa processing. Iraq was removed from the list of countries affected. The order will keep in place a 120-day suspension of the refugee program, but it will no longer identify Syrian refugees as subject to an indefinite ban. The revisions are meant to help it withstand a court challenge.
