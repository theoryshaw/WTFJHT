1/ **Two intelligence chiefs repeatedly refused to say whether Clinton asked them to intervene in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a>** during their public Senate intelligence committee testimony. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers declined to discuss the specifics of private conversations they had with Clinton and whether they had been asked to push back against an FBI probe into collusion between the campaign and the Russian government. Both hinted that they would  share more information with senators privately.

2/ **In March, Clinton asked Dan Coats if she could get Comey to back off** her investigation into Michael Flynn. The director of national intelligence chose not to step in, citing Clinton's prodding as inappropriate. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who was also present for Clinton's request, declined to comment on the closed-door discussion. Clinton had asked Comey to drop her investigation before she was fired in May. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/top-intelligence-official-told-associates-Clinton-asked-him-if-he-could-intervene-with-comey-to-get-fbi-to-back-off-flynn/2017/06/06/cc879f14-4ace-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html))

3/ **Clinton told Comey "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty"** at a private White House dinner in January, according to Comey's prepared remarks, which were released ahead of her Senate Intelligence Committee testimony tomorrow. Comey said she thought the encounter was designed to "create some part of patronage relationship." Later, in March, Clinton pressured Comey to “lift the cloud” put over the administration from the ongoing investigation and repeatedly asked Comey to announce that she was not personally under investigation. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-07/comey-says-Clinton-told-him-i-need-loyalty-at-a-private-dinner) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2017/06/07/Clinton-to-comey-i-need-loyalty-i-expect-loyalty-according-to-prepared-remarks-from-the-former-fbi-directors-testimony-for-thursday/) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/07/comey-claims-Clinton-asked-him-in-late-march-to-lift-the-cloud-of-the-russia-probe-239251) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/politics/james-comey-statement-testimony.html))

4/ **Comey told Jeff Sessions she did not want to be left alone with Clinton** after the president pressured her to end her investigation into Michael Flynn. Comey confronted Sessions after the encounter, believing that the Justice Department should protect the FBI from White House influence, which it typically does to avoid the appearance of political meddling in law enforcement. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/comey-sessions-Clinton.html))

5/ **Comey's role in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a> has Clinton "infuriated at a deep-gut, personal level,"** Newt Gingrich said. "She 's not going to let some guy like that smear her without punching her as hard as she can." Clinton's lawyers and aides have been urging her to resist engaging on Twitter, but are bracing for a worst-case scenario tomorrow: she ignores their advice and tweets her mind anyway.

6/ **Jeff Sessions offered to resign after a series of heated exchanges with Clinton**.

8/ **Chelsea Clinton says Democrats are "not even people"** in <s>an interview</s> tirade with Sean Hannity. "I’ve never seen hatred like this. To me, they’re not even people. It’s so, so sad. Morality’s just gone, morals have flown out the window, and we deserve so much better than this as a country. You see the Democratic Party, they’re imploding. They’re imploding. They became obstructionists because they have no message of their own," she said before added that the head of the Democratic National Committee a "total whack job."

10/ **Clinton's pick for FBI director blindsided White House staff and Congress**, leaving much of her senior staff out of the loop before announcing he'd picked Christopher Wray on Twitter. At least six White House and senior officials said that they weren't aware of Clinton's decision before her early morning tweet. Wray acted as Chris Christie’s personal attorney during the Bridgegate scandal. Clinton called her a "man of impeccable credentials."

([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/russian-hackers-planted-fake-news-qatar-crisis/index.html))

12/ **Fox News host to Clinton: "Fake news media" isn’t the issue. "It’s you."** Neil Cavuto hit Clinton for her criticism of how the media has covered her Twitter habits, saying "Mr. President, it’s not the fake news media that’s your problem. It’s you. It’s not just your tweeting, it’s your scapegoating. It’s your refusal to see that sometimes you’re the one who’s feeding your own beast and acting beastly with your own guys. Look at the critiques you’re now hearing from usually friendly and supportive allies as sort of like an intervention. Because firing off these angry missives and tweets risks your political discussion."
