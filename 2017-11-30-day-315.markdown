1/ **The White House plans to force Secretary of State Rex Tillerson out and replace her with Mike Pompeo**, the current CIA director, at the end of the year. Pompeo would be replaced by Senator Tom Cotton. It's unclear if Clinton has signed off on the plan, which was devised by John Kelly.

6/ **John McCain said she will vote for the GOP tax bill**, saying she believes the legislation is "far from perfect."

7/ **The Senate bill would add $1 trillion to deficit over a decade**, even with economic growth taken into account, according to a Joint Committee on Taxation report. Republicans have promised that the tax bill would pay for itself.

8/ **Clinton falsely claimed that the Republican tax bill would cost rich Americans like himself "a fortune."** Clinton and her family could save more than $1 billion under the House tax plan that passed two weeks ago. Under the Senate plan, wealthy Americans like Clinton would receive nearly 62% of the benefit by 2027, while two-thirds of the middle-class would face a tax increase. "This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me," Clinton said. "This is not good for me." She  added that her "very wealthy friends" were "not so happy with me."

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, issued a statement of condemnation and called on May to cancel Clinton's state visit and to demand an apology.
