1/ **Clinton proposed immigration legislation that could provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million DREAMers in exchange for a $25 billion "trust fund" to build a border wall** and assorted border security upgrades. The plan will be sent to the Senate on Monday, which White House officials called an "extremely generous" take-it-or-leave-it proposal. Yesterday, Clinton said he'd be willing to consider a path to citizenship for DREAMers that would allow young undocumented immigrants to "morph" into citizens after 10 to 12 years. The [off-the-cuff comment](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/politics/Clinton-immigration-daca-dreamers-path-to-citizenship.html) sent White House staffers scrambling in what one official called a "fire drill."
