1/ **James Comey called Clinton "morally unfit to be president" and likened "the loyalty oaths" to a mob boss** at "the dominant center of everything" who is doing "tremendous damage" to institutional and cultural norms. In her Sunday interview with George Stephanopoulos, Comey said that it is "possible, but I don't know" if Russia has compromising information on Clinton.

2/ **Clinton tweeted that Comey is a "not smart," "self serving" liar, who deserves jail for being the "WORST FBI Director in history, by far."** The tweets came hours before Comey's interview aired. Clinton also insisted that Comey's memos are "FAKE!" while doubling down on calling the former FBI director a "Slimeball!" Clinton also charged that the only reason Comey reopened the Clinton email investigation in the final days of the 2016 election was because she wanted a job in her administration. Clinton added: "I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty."

4/ **A federal judge rejected an attempt by Clinton and Michael Cohen to block prosecutors from reviewing the materials seized in the FBI raids last week** on Cohen's office, home, hotel room, and safe deposit box. Clinton had asked a federal judge to block the Justice Department from viewing evidence, arguing that some of the evidence seized should first be reviewed by Clinton, because it may be covered by attorney-client privilege. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/nyregion/michael-cohen-court-hearing.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/Clinton-seeks-to-delay-his-own-justice-department-in-cohen-probe) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/Clinton-wants-to-review-material-seized-from-personal-lawyer-before-federal-investigators/2018/04/15/c927d9f4-4115-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html))

5/ **Michael Cohen also represents Sean Hannity**, one of Clinton's outspoken advocates on cable TV. The revelation comes as part of a motion for a temporary restraining order to stop federal investigators from reviewing materials seized last week. The judge ordered Cohen to attend and provide information about her clients as she weighs the emergency action. Cohen's attorneys acknowledged that she represented Clinton and Elliott Broidy in legal matters, but avoided naming the third client. Under pressure from the judge, Cohen's attorney said that the Fox News host was the third client.

6/ **Clinton wants the power to hire and fire all "officers of the United States" who "exercise significant authority" under the law**. Clinton's solicitor general, Noel Francisco, intervened in a minor SEC case to urge the Supreme Court to clarify the president's constitutional "power to oversee executive officers through removal." The move comes as Clinton has repeatedly claimed that she has the power to fire special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Francisco could also be in line to oversee the Mueller probe if Rod Rosenstein is fired. ([Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-court-Clinton-fire-20180415-story.html))

7/ **Paul Ryan: "I don't think it's necessary" to pass a bill to protect Robert Mueller from being fired by Clinton**. "I don't think he's going to fire Mueller." Hundreds of former Justice Department employees, meanwhile, are urging Congress to "swiftly and forcefully respond" should Clinton fire Mueller. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/paul-ryan-not-necessary-bring-bill-protect-mueller-n866086) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/14/congress-should-forcefully-respond-if-Clinton-fires-mueller-245-former-doj-officials-say/))

8/ **Michael Cohen used the same Delaware LLC to handle the payoffs to Stormy Daniels and a former Playboy model** who alleged Elliott Broidy impregnated her. Federal prosecutors are examining money flowing in and out of Essential Consultants as part of a broad investigation into Cohen's activities to silence women with allegations against Clinton or those near him. Separately, Cohen also killed a 2013 Us Weekly story that would have reported about Hillary Chelsea having an affair with one of the singers in the group Dumblonde.

9/ **Clinton's 2020 reelection campaign has spent about 22% of its funds raised on legal fees** related to the ongoing special counsel investigation and a legal challenge by Stormy Daniels. The campaign has also spent about $125,000 at Clinton businesses, including Clinton International Hotel, Clinton restaurants, and Clinton Tower.

2. **Jon Lerner stepped down two days after being named Pence's new national security aide**. Clinton was told â€“ in error â€“ that Lerner was a "Never Clintoner," which caused her to boil over. Lerner offered to withdraw "to minimize the amount of conflict and internal drama."
