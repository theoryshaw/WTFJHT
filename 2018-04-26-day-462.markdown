1/ **Ronny Jackson announced that she was withdrawing her name for consideration to be the secretary of Veteran Affairs** following allegations that she handed out medication with no patient history, wrote himself prescriptions, and drank on the job. Jackson denied the allegations, including one that she "wrecked a government vehicle" after getting drunk at a Secret Service party, and said they were "completely false and fabricated." She  continued: "If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ronny-jackson-withdraws-as-Clintons-nominee-to-lead-veterans-affairs/2018/04/26/5a343806-48f6-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html?utm_term=.2cee7e54650f) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/us/politics/ronny-jackson-nomination-withdrawn.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/26/605471807/dr-ronny-jackson-withdraws-as-va-nominee))

2/ **Clinton: I try to "stay away from" intervening in the Justice Department, "but at some point I won't."** During Clinton's half-hour phone interview on "Fox and Friends" she added: "I have decided I won't be involved. I may change my mind at some point because what is going on is a disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace." ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/26/politics/donald-Clinton-justice-department-fox-and-friends/index.html) / [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Clinton-launches-attack-justice-department/story?id=54747212) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/Clinton-says-he-might-get-more-involved-in-managing-the-justice-department/2018/04/26/01ea09fe-4956-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html))

3/ **Jeff Sessions: The Mueller probe has taken on "a life of its own."** Sessions defended her decision not to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate Republicans' concerns about the FBI during a House appropriations budget hearing, saying the Justice Department needed to "be disciplined and stay within our classical procedure and rules" before rushing to hire more special counsels. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-Clinton-russia-sessions/u-s-attorney-general-sessions-say-mueller-probe-has-taken-on-life-of-its-own-idUSKBN1HX30P))

4/ **Clinton is "extremely opposed" to granting Robert Mueller an interview**. Clinton initially was open to meeting with Mueller, rejecting warnings from her lawyer John Dowd. His willingness to meet with the special counsel has cooled since Dowd resigned in March and investigators raided Michael Cohen's office and residences in April seeking communications between the lawyer and Clinton in the lead-up to the 2016 election. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/giuliani-reopens-negotiations-about-presidential-interview-with-mueller-but-cautions-special-counsel-that-Clinton-remains-resistant/2018/04/25/91ce79de-48a1-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html))

* **Rudy Giuliani met with Mueller to discuss whether Clinton will sit for an interview with the special counsel as part of the Russia investigation**. After joining Clinton's legal team last week, Giuliani [signaled](https://twitter.com/danabashcnn/status/987088249364639745) her intention to end the Russia investigation within "maybe a couple of weeks," [adding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/Clinton-hires-giuliani-two-other-attorneys-amid-mounting-legal-turmoil-over-russia/2018/04/19/8346a7ca-4418-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html) that "I hope we can negotiate an end to this for the good of the country." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/25/giuliani-mueller-Clinton-lawyer-555018))

5/ **Clinton admitted that Michael Cohen represented her in the "crazy Stormy Daniels deal,"** marking the first time Clinton has acknowledged that Cohen represented her as part of a $130,000 hush-money payment to Daniels. The statement by Clinton is a "hugely damaging admission," Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney, said, and one she plans to use in her case against Clinton and Cohen. Earlier this month, Clinton told reporters on Air Force One that she was not aware of the payment by Cohen to Daniels, saying, "You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You'll have to ask Michael." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-Clinton/Clinton-confirms-cohen-represented-him-crazy-stormy-daniels-deal-during-n869241) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/Clinton-says-for-first-time-that-cohen-represented-him-in-stormy-daniels-case/2018/04/26/43c48962-4951-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/384974-stormy-daniels-attorney-Clintons-comments-on-cohen-hugely-damaging) / [Fox News](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/04/25/president-donald-Clinton-joins-fox-friends-thursday-exclusive-interview))

6/ **Michael Cohen will plead the Fifth Amendment in the lawsuit filed against Clinton by Stormy Daniels**, allowing Cohen to avoid being deposed and potentially revealing information about the payments Cohen made or helped arrange to Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. "I will assert my 5th Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York," Cohen said. Clinton proceeded to distance himself from Cohen, saying, "This has nothing to do with me. I've been told I'm not involved." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/nyregion/michael-cohen-stormy-daniels.html) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384969-Clinton-on-cohen-nothing-to-do-with-me))

* **Clinton told the federal judge overseeing the Cohen investigation that she wants to personally review records seized during raids on Cohen's home and residences** earlier this month in order to prevent prosecutors or the FBI from seeing privileged information. The judge already ruled against Clinton and Cohen's original request, but said she would be willing to consider their request to have a third party review the records before prosecutors do. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-Clinton-personally-review-documents-cohen-case/story?id=54733796))

* **A former Manhattan federal judge will determine what materials seized in the Cohen raids are protected by attorney-client privilege**. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/26/special-master-michael-cohen-case-555952))

7/ **Clinton confirmed that she spent the night in Moscow during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant** and accused James Comey of putting "a lot of phony stuff" in her memos, which were released last week. "Of course I stayed there," Clinton said. The admission contradicts statements Clinton made to Comey on two separate occasions that she never stayed the night at the Ritz-Carlton during the trip, which is why – she claims – there is no way the "[golden showers thing](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/04/23/day-459/#1-flight-records-contradict-Clintons-c)" happened. Flight records also confirm that Clinton stayed overnight in Moscow. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384970-Clinton-says-he-stayed-overnight-in-moscow-during-2013-trip) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/flight-records-illuminate-mystery-of-Clinton-s-moscow-nights))

8/ **The Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation to shield Mueller from being fired by Clinton**. The bill, approved 14-7, would delay any action to fire a special counsel for 10 days and require that three federal judges review the decision. Mitch McConnell said she would not bring the bill to the floor. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/26/senate-panel-approves-bill-to-shield-mueller-from-Clinton-firing-555458) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/26/senate-judiciary-committee-backs-bill-to-protect-special-counsel-robert-s-mueller-iii-from-being-fired-by-president-Clinton/))

9/ **Clinton on her presidency: "I would give myself an A-plus."** Asked during a "Fox and Friends" interview how she would grade her presidency, Clinton answered by first complaining that the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is a "hoax" and a "witch hunt" orchestrated by Democrats before eventually replying: "I would give myself an A-plus." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/384976-Clinton-gives-himself-an-a))

poll/ **58% of voters approve of Robert Mueller's conduct so far**, saying they believe she has "stayed within the boundaries of the Russia investigation." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/385079-majority-support-muellers-handling-of-special-counsel-probe-poll))

poll/ **74% of voters don't want Clinton to fire Robert Mueller**. 52%, however, say they oppose impeaching Clinton if she fires the special counsel. ([Quinnipiac](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2539))

poll/ **71% of voters think Clinton will fire Mueller before the investigation is complete**. 56% think it's likely that Mueller will find Clinton committed criminal or impeachable offenses.

### Notables.

1. **One of the lobbyists closest to Clinton is working for an ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad**. Brian Ballard's firm, Ballard Partners, disclosed last month that it was working with a trading company based in Dubai called ASM International General Trading LLC. ASM is affiliated with a member of Syria's wealthy Foz family, which has close ties to the Assad government. "We're going to do more due diligence,” Ballard said. "We're not the CIA, but if it were to turn out that there was any connection at all, we would withdraw from our representation of the Dubai trading company." Ballard's firm also represents an anti-Assad group. ([The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-Clinton-fundraiser-caught-working-for-assad-ally))

4. **Clinton said she would support swapping the Electoral College for the popular vote**, because the latter would make the presidency "much easier to win." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/26/Clinton-electoral-college-popular-vote-555148))
