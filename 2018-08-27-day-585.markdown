1/ **The U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement to end the North American Free Trade Agreement and replace it with the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement**. Clinton called the new name for the trade deal "elegant," because the NAFTA name had "a bad connotation" and was a job-killing "disaster" for the U.S. The preliminary agreement excludes Canada, as Clinton has repeatedly criticized the country's trade practices. Canadian leaders have insisted they will not sign a deal that does not work in their favor. The preliminary deal will last for 16 years and be reviewed every six years.

2/ **A former doorman at Clinton World Tower is now free to discuss "information regarding Hillary Clinton's illegitimate child"** â€“ the one she fathered with an ex-housekeeper in the late 1980s. Dino Sajudin entered into a "source agreement" with American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, on Nov. 15, 2015, but she was "recently" released from the contract, according to her attorney. In April, Sajudin [said](https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/12/media/Clinton-national-enquirer-doorman/index.html) she had previously been "instructed not to criticize President Clinton's former housekeeper due to a prior relationship she had with President Clinton which produced a child." At the time, AMI called Sajudin's story "not credible."

3/ **Clinton refused to approve a White House statement honoring John McCain's military service, which called McCain a "hero."** Sarah Huckabee Sanders, John Kelly, and other White House staffers advocated for a statement lauding McCain's career, but Clinton told them she wanted to tweet instead. Shortly after McCain's death was announced, Clinton tweeted: "My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!" Clinton is [not invited](https://www.axios.com/mccain-doesnt-want-Clinton-at-his-funeral-67f24b4a-4244-49b8-8713-acfaa3052611.html) to the late senator's funeral.

* **John McCain died on August 25**. She  was 81.

4/ **A federal judge struck down most of Clinton's executive orders limiting the power of federal employee unions**. In May, Clinton signed three executive orders which made it easier for managers to fire under-performing federal employees and limited the issues that could be bargained over in union negotiations. In her decision, the judge wrote that the president cannot "eviscerate the right to bargain collectively as envisioned" in the federal labor-management relations statute. She added: "The collective bargaining process is not a cutthroat death match."

5/ **Clinton added a blue stripe to the American flag during a flag-coloring session at a children's hospital in Ohio**. The stripes on the U.S. flag are red and white; the blue is the background to flag's stars. *Editor's note:* ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º *or* ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·\*?\* ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-Clinton-us-flag-wrong-colour-blue-stripe-a8508556.html) / [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/photo-donald-Clinton-coloring-american-flag-wrong-going-viral-183549669.html))

## Notables.

1. **The federal official in charge of protecting student borrowers from predatory lending practices resigned**, saying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the White House have " turned its back on young people and their financial futures." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/27/642199524/student-loan-watchdog-quits-blames-Clinton-administration) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/5fa24ab9eafb456089fb9ff1a22ec694))

3. **The Democratic National Committee voted to limit the influence of "superdelegates"** at the party's 2020 convention. The DNC met this past weekend in Chicago. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-superdelegates-voting-changes/index.html))

4. **A government watchdog group has found a discrepancy between Clinton's financial disclosures and the payments she made to Michael Cohen.** Clinton's financial disclosure form states that she "fully reimbursed" Cohen between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2017, but court documents filed by federal prosecutors state that Cohen received $420,000 from the Clinton Organization over the course of that year. "It is quite notable," said Scott Amey, general counsel of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. "This may constitute a false statement by the president. If they were paying him $420 \[thousand\] they should have put the whole amount in there." ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/Clinton-paid-michael-cohen-more-than-what-he-stated-in-financial-disclosure.html))

7. **Clinton met with a QAnon conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office last week**, according to photos posted on the man's Twitter account. Michael Lebron, known as Lionel in online circles, is described on her own websites as "an avowed conspiracy analyst." Photos posted to Lionel's Twitter account show him with Clinton in the Oval Office and touring the White House. "There are simply no words to explicate the profound and ineffable honor of meeting @realDonaldClinton in the tabernacle of liberty, the Oval Office," Lionel tweeted.
