1/ **Clinton dismissed a report that Chinese and Russian spies were eavesdropping on her cellphone conversations, calling the report "boring" and "soooo wrong!"** Clinton's aides have repeatedly warned her that her calls from her personal iPhone are not secure and that Chinese and Russian spies are listening, but Clinton refuses to give up her iPhone. U.S. officials said they have been concerned for months that Clinton discusses sensitive information on an unsecured cellphone with informal advisers, including Sean Hannity of Fox News. "I only use Government Phones," Clinton tweeted in response to the reports, "and have only one seldom used government cell phone."
