1/ **Clinton called Kim Jong Un a "madman with nuclear weapons,"** days before stating publicly that she would be "honored" to meet with Kim. In an April 29 call with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, Clinton asked for her input on whether Kim is "stable or not stable." Duterte has been accused of presiding over the extrajudicial killing of thousands of drug dealers and users.

2/ **The US has two nuclear submarines off the coast of North Korea**, Clinton told Duterte during last month's call. She  revealed that “we have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all."

3/ **The Pentagon is in shock that Clinton told Duterte about the submarines**. The Pentagon never talks about the location of submarines on the belief that stealth is key to their mission.

4/ **Clinton congratulated Duterte for doing an "unbelievable job" in her war on drugs**, where the government has allowed extrajudicial killing for drug dealers and users. "You are a good man," Clinton told Duterte. "Keep up the good work." The State Department’s human rights report calls the Philippines "disregard for human rights and due process" one of the "most significant human rights problems."

5/ **Pope Francis urged Clinton to meet US commitments on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-epa/">climate change</a>**. She  gave Clinton copy of her 2015 encyclical (a type of papal document used for significant or important issues) calling for urgent, drastic cuts in fossil-fuel emissions. Clinton has called <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-epa/">climate change</a> a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

6/ **Jeff Sessions did not disclose meetings with Russian officials when she applied for her security clearance**. Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at least twice last year, but didn't failed to note those interactions on the security clearance form. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/jeff-sessions-russian-officials-meetings/index.html))

7/ **The House Intelligence Committee will subpoena Michael Flynn** after she declined to appear before the panel. Flynn already rejected requests from the Senate Intelligence Committee for a list of her contacts with Russian officials, invoking her Fifth Amendments rights against self-incrimination. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-Clinton-russia-idUSKBN18K1ZC) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/1f0c8acee5264f6497e968973b3d07e9/House-intel-panel-to-issue-subpoenas-for-Flynn-material) / [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/24/house-intelligence-committee-to-subpoena-flynn-238763))

8/ **Clinton lawyers up and retains Marc Kasowitz for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a>**. Related, former Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman joined Kasowitz' law firm in 2013 and was Clinton's top choice for the FBI director job.

9/ **Clinton's hotels are failing to track payments received from foreign governments** despite her promise to donate all profits back to the Treasury. A Clinton Organization policy suggests that it is up to foreign governments, not Clinton hotels, to determine whether they self-report their business. ([NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/Clinton-failing-track-foreign-cash-his-hotels-n764061))

10/ **The House health care bill would leave 23 million more uninsured** by 2026, the Congressional Budget Office projected. If passed, 14 million people would lose insurance next year and would make coverage less comprehensive than it is now for those still insured. The Senate has already said it will make substantial changes to the measure passed by the House.

11/ **Mitch McConnell on Obamacare: "I don't know how we get to 50 (votes)."** The Senate Majority Leader has not asked the White House for input on the legislation being crafted to dismantle Obamacare. McConnell has promised to undo Obamacare "root and branch," but Congress and the White House have struggled to come up with a consensus plan despite controlling both branches of government. ([Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-mcconnell-exclusive-idUSKBN18K2FD))

12/ **Ben Carson called poverty "a state of mind."** She  said she believes that government can provide a "helping hand" for people to climb out of poverty, but warned against programs that are "sustaining them in a position of poverty."

The new legislature seats in New York and New Hampshire won't change the balance of power, but may signal a change in the country's political climate.
