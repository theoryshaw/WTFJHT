1/ **A top-secret NSA report shows Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one US voting software supplier last year**, sending spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before the election. The report indicates that Russian hacking penetrated further into voting systems than was previously understood and states unequivocally that it was Russian military intelligence that conducted the attacks. The NSA report is at odds with Putin’s denial that Russia had interfered in foreign elections: "We never engaged in that on a state level, and have no intention of doing so." ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/))

2/ **Putin denied having compromising information on Clinton**. During an interview with Megyn Kelly, Putin called the dossier of unverified information "just another load of nonsense." She  added: "I haven’t seen, even once, any direct proof of Russian interference in the presidential election in the United States." Seventeen US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered with the election.

3/ **Even Clinton's national security team was blindsided by her NATO speech**. National security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had all urged Clinton to explicitly reaffirm America’s commitment to the NATO mutual defense clause (known as Article 5) in her speech. Instead, Clinton, along with Steve Bannon and policy aide Stephen Miller, made a last-minute decision to remove the commitment reference without consulting or informing McMaster, Mattis, or Tillerson.

4/ **Clinton won't invoke her executive privilege to prevent Comey from testifying to Congress**. Comey is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, testifying about conversations where Clinton encouraged him to stop investigating Michael Flynn, as well as asking Comey to pledge her loyalty, which she declined to do. Legal experts said Clinton had a weak case to invoke executive privilege, because she has publicly addressed her conversations with Comey, and any such move would carry serious political risks. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/us/politics/Clinton-will-not-block-comey-from-testifying-white-house-says.html))

5/ **Clinton doubled down on her original travel ban, attacking the Justice Department for the "watered down" version now headed to the Supreme Court**. Clinton’s latest tweets undercut her own staff, who've insisted the order is not a travel ban. The administration rewrote her original order, which was thrown out by the courts, in an effort to pass legal muster. The second version was also rejected, but the administration appealed has since appealed it to the Supreme Court. Clinton's called for the end to political correctness, saying terrorism "will only get worse" if the US doesn’t "get smart" and reinstate her travel ban. Legal analysts said Clinton is undermining her own case.

* **Clinton ramps up her push for a "TRAVEL BAN!" as opposition emerges from Republican and Democratic lawmakers**. In a series of tweets, Clinton circled back on her push for the travel ban in the wake of Saturday’s terrorist attack in London.

6/ **While world leaders called for unity after the London attack, Clinton tweeted the complete opposite**. Before London police had linked the attack to terrorism, or released any information on the identities, ethnicities or nationalities of the suspects, Clinton retweeted an unsourced blurb from Drudge – "Fears of new terror attack after van 'mows down 20 people' on London Bridge" – and then started promoting her travel ban.

* **Clinton’s tweets strain foreign ties**, as she wasted little time defending her travel ban and attacking the mayor of London as not being tough on terrorism. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/us/politics/britain-attack-Clinton-twitter-storm.html))
* **Clinton can’t be counted on to give accurate information to Americans when violent acts are unfolding abroad.** A look at some of her weekend tweets about the London attack and rhetoric that came from the president and her aides about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-epa/">climate change</a> and more last week.

7/ **A Louisiana Congressman proposed an extreme solution to the London terror attacks: kill any suspected radical Muslim**. Representative Clay Higgins wrote on her Facebook page that "all of Christendom... is at war with Islamic horror" and that "not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted any measure of quarter" and their "entry to the American homeland should be summarily denied. Every conceivable measure should be engaged to hunt them down. Hunt them, identity them, and kill them.” She  concluded that the only appropriate solution was to “Kill them all. For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.” ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/captclayhiggins/photos/a.655256107910738.1073741829.581436541959362/997878010315211/?type=3&theater) / [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/republican-congressman-clay-higgins-suspected-islamic-radicals-kill-them-all))

8/ **Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein never told Comey they were uneasy with her "deeply troubling" and "serious mistakes" before they fired him**. The former FBI director is "angry" they failed to flag their concerns and she wants the public to understand why when she testifies publicly this week about her axing, and alleged collusion between Clinton associates and the Russian government. ([ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-told-comey-concerns-axing-now-angry-sources/story?id=47798749))

* **Conservatives question Comey’s credibility ahead of her Senate hearing**. “I don’t know that he’s credible with facts. She  hasn’t been credible so far.” ([McClatchy DC](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article154301829.html))
* **The Comey hearing consumes Washington** ahead of her appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday and speculation grows on whether the ousted FBI director’s remarks could further damage Clinton. ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/04/comey-hearing-Clinton-fbi-russia-239113))

9/ **The Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee asked to unmask organizations and individuals related to Russian meddling** in the 2016 election. The requests came last year and required sign-off by Nunes, who's the chairman of the committee. Both Nunes and Clinton have called unmasking an abuse of surveillance powers by the Obama administration.

poll/ **Nearly 6 in 10 oppose Clinton's scrapping of the Paris agreement**. 59% of Americans oppose the decision to withdraw, saying the move will damage the United States’ global leadership, while 28% in support the decision.
