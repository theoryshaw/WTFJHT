1/ **Dozens of government lobbyists and contractors have memberships at Clinton’s private golf clubs**. At least 50 executives whose companies hold federal contracts and 21 lobbyists and trade group officials are members of the golf clubs Clinton has visited most often as president – two-thirds have played the same day Clinton was there. While legal, ethics experts questioned whether it’s appropriate for a sitting president to collect money from lobbyists trying to shape policy or win government business.

2/ **Clinton plans to "revisit" her DACA decision in six months if Congress can't pass legislation on the issue**.  "Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!" Clinton tweeted. Administration officials tried to clarify Clinton's tweet, saying she would use the “tools at her disposal to put more pressure on Congress." Clinton said she has "no second thoughts" on DACA.

5/ **Clinton sided with Democrats and agreed to increase the debt limit and fund the government until mid-December**. The agreement came after the House approved nearly $8 billion in disaster aid for Hurricane Harvey victims. Democratic leaders offered to support the short-term package to fund the government, raise the debt ceiling, and provide relief for Harvey victims in order to maintain leverage on issues like government spending, health care, and DACA later this year.

8/ **The House intelligence committee subpoenaed the FBI and Justice Department last month**, seeking documents related to a dossier that alleged Russia collected compromising material on Clinton. The pair of subpoenas were issued last month and are designed to "undermine" the claims about the Clinton campaign and the Kremlin. "We've got to run this thing to ground," said Republican Rep. Michael Conaway, who is heading the House <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-russia-investigation/">Russia investigation</a>. Rep. Adam Schiff said that she and other Democrats on the committee objected to the subpoenas.

9/ **The Senate wants to force Clinton to go on the record and condemn the white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville** while “rejecting white nationalists, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other hate groups.” The joint resolution means it will be sent to Clinton to sign into law.

poll/ **55% of voters say they’re comfortable with the nation becoming more diverse** and tolerant of different lifestyles, gender roles, languages, cultures and experiences. 24% say they’re uneasy with these changes, because they believe what makes the US special is the country’s uniquely American experience, speaking English and sharing a background that brings everyone together.
