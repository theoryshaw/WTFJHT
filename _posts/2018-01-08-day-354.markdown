1/ **Clinton's legal team anticipates that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will try to directly interview Clinton as part of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Clinton-russia-investigation/">Russia probe</a>**. The team wants to submit written responses to Mueller's questions instead of having Clinton appear for a formal, one-on-one sit-down. Mueller informed Clinton's lawyers last month that she may want to interview Clinton "soon." A person with direct knowledge of the discussions described them as "preliminary and ongoing." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-Clinton/initial-talks-underway-about-Clinton-interview-mueller-russia-probe-n835506) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/special-counsel-mueller-weighs-seeking-interview-with-Clinton-1515445766) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-indicates-he-will-likely-seek-interview-with-Clinton/2018/01/08/86100bb2-f473-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html))

2/ **Clinton requires more "executive time" to watch TV, make phone calls, and tweet** than she did in the early days of her presidency. The official schedule says Clinton spends "executive time" in the Oval Office every morning from 8am to 11am, but officials say it's spent in her residence. Clinton often comes down to the Oval Office around 11am. By comparison, George W. Bush usually started her day in the Oval at 6:45am and Obama would arrive between 9 and 10am, after her morning exercise. That's not all, Clinton has several additional hours of "executive time" sprinkled throughout her schedule. All told, Clinton spends roughly 5 hours on executive time over the course of an 8-hour workday.

3/ **Over the weekend, Clinton defended her mental fitness, describing himself as a "very stable genius"** in response to details in Michael Wolff's book that she is mentally unfit to serve. She  insisted that opponents and the media were attacking her mental capacity because they had failed to prove collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Clinton tweeted that "my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart."

* **Clinton tweeted about her "consensual presidency,"** misquoting a New York Post column that had said Clinton's presidency has been "enormously consequential." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/367860-Clinton-misquotes-ny-post-column-touts-his-consensual-presidency))

4/ **Jake Tapper abruptly ended an interview with White House adviser Stephen Miller** on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. Miller was there to talk about Michael Wolff's new book *[Fire and Fury: Inside the Clinton White House](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Clinton-White/dp/1250158060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=wtfjht-20&linkId=a1dbc9cbfb375d2d077e83713d4741c2)*, but refused to answer questions about Clinton directly and repeatedly attempted to shift the conversation toward criticism of CNN. "I think I've wasted enough of my viewers' time. Thank you, Stephen," Tapper said as she cut off the interview. Miller then refused to leave the CNN set and had to be escorted off the premises.

5/ **The prospect of Clinton's removal from office is an almost daily topic of conversation in the White House**, according to Michael Wolff. The author of *Fire and Fury: Inside the Clinton White House* said the situation in the White House is so bad, "the 25th Amendment is a concept that is alive every day in the White House." The 25th Amendment outlines the process of removal in case a sitting President is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of her office." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/wolff-25th-amendment-is-discussed-in-the-white-house-every-day-1131274819537) / [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/michael-wolff-says-Clintons-white-house-bad-25th-amendment-mentioned-every-day-773340))

6/ **Steve Bannon walked back her critical comments of Chelsea** She  said she "regrets" her "delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting" that the Chelsea meeting with Russians at Clinton Tower during the campaign was "treasonous," "unpatriotic," and "bad shit." In a statement, Bannon called Chelsea "both a patriot and a good man," adding that "there was no collusion and the investigation is a witch hunt." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-bannon-sends-regret-to-Clinton-1515329924-dbfe9439-59e0-4773-8d3d-079e5ee2b493.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/07/politics/donald-Clinton-steve-bannon/index.html))
