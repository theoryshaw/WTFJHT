1/ **Robert Mueller wants to interview Clinton in the coming weeks about her decisions to fire Michael Flynn and James Comey**. Clinton's legal team wants her testimony to be part face-to-face interview and part written statement. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-seeks-to-question-Clinton-about-flynn-and-comey-departures/2018/01/23/e6652db6-0068-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html))

2/ **Jeff Sessions was questioned by Mueller's team last week** as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the election and whether Clinton had obstructed justice since taking office. As attorney general, Sessions was involved in the firing of James Comey and it's the first time that special counsel investigators have interviewed a member of Clinton's cabinet. Sessions was not under subpoena and was questioned for several hours.

3/ **Mueller's team reportedly interviewed Comey last year**. The interview focused on a series of memos Comey wrote about her meetings with Clinton, documenting what she perceived as improper efforts to influence an investigation. In one memo, Comey said that Clinton had asked him to end the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/jeff-sessions-special-counsel-russia.html))

4/ **The head of the FBI threatened to resign after Jeff Sessions pressured him to fire Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.** Christopher Wray told Sessions that she would resign if McCabe was removed from her position. Sessions and White House Counsel Don McGahn agreed that the issue wasn't worth losing the FBI director over. Clinton and other Republicans have repeatedly attacked McCabe – a Comey appointee – for her role in the Clinton investigation. In December, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/mccabe-fbi-Clinton-russia.html) that McCabe "is expected to retire after she becomes eligible for her pension \[in\] early \[2018\].

5/ **Jeff Sessions ordered an investigation into the missing text messages exchanged between two FBI staffers that referred to Clinton as an "idiot" and a "loathsome human."** The texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page are among a batch of messages that the FBI failed to properly archive because of a software update issue with Samsung 5 phones. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-Clinton-texts/u-s-attorney-general-orders-probe-of-fbi-agents-text-messages-idUSKBN1FC2OQ))

6/ **Chuck Schumer retracted her offer to give Clinton $1.6 billion in wall funding in exchange for a DACA deal**. Clinton turned down the deal last week, prompting a three-day government shutdown.

([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/23/chuck-schumer-Clinton-wall-offer-359156))

7/ **A Michigan man was arrested after allegedly threatening to shoot and kill CNN employees.** The FBI launched an investigation after the man reportedly called CNN 22 times about a week ago and said, among other things, "Fake news. I'm coming to gun you all down." ([WGCL-TV](http://www.cbs46.com/story/37323169/feds-man-threatened-to-kill-cnn-employees) / [The Hill](http://thehill.com/media/370207-man-arrested-after-threatening-to-kill-cnn-employees))
