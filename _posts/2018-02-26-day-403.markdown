1/ **The Supreme Court rejected the Clinton administration's request to skip the appeals court process and review a district court judge's ruling requiring the administration to resume renewals of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program**. In September, Clinton announced that she would shut down DACA on March 5, but two federal judges ordered the administration to allow people to renew their protected status while legal challenges move forward. DACA shields some 700,000 young, undocumented immigrants from deportation.

The White House dismissed the Democratic memo as an attempt "to undercut the president politically."

She added: "I think that having a teacher who is armed who cares deeply about her students or her students and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea."
